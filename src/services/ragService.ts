Analyze the patient's weather-related health risk based on the following parameters:

- Temperature: ${weather.temperature}¬∞C
- Humidity: ${weather.humidity}%
- PM2.5: ${weather.pm25} ¬µg/m¬≥
- AQI: ${weather.aqi}
- Ozone: ${weather.ozone} ¬µg/m¬≥
- Barometric Pressure Drop (last 24h): ${weather.pressureDrop} hPa
- Birch Pollen: ${weather.birchPollen} grains/m¬≥
- Grass Pollen: ${weather.grassPollen} grains/m¬≥
- Mugwort Pollen: ${weather.mugwortPollen} grains/m¬≥
- Alder Pollen: ${weather.alderPollen} grains/m¬≥
- Ragweed Pollen: ${weather.ragweedPollen} grains/m¬≥

The patient is diagnosed with the following condition(s): ${condition}.

Your task is to determine if the current weather parameters pose a health risk **strictly based on quantitative thresholds** defined by medical or environmental guidelines. All comparisons must be **numerically precise** (e.g., PM2.5 ‚â• 25 is risky; PM2.5 = 24.9999 is not risky).

You MUST return only a **valid, parsable JSON object** in the following exact format:

{
  "risk_found": "true" or "false", // "true" only if one or more thresholds are crossed
  "risk_condition": "comma-separated list of affected conditions (e.g., Asthma, Heart Failure)",
  "triggers": {
    "parameter_name": "concise reason explaining why this parameter is a trigger (e.g., PM2.5: exceeds threshold for respiratory risk). Moderate and High risk triggers should be reasoned for decision"
  },
  "recommendation": "clear and direct advice (in second person) in english language based on the triggers parameter_name above, including emojis if appropriate (e.g., Wear a mask üò∑ due to poor air quality)."
}

Strict Rules:
- DO NOT add any extra text, markdown, headers, bullet points, or explanation outside the JSON object.
- DO NOT round or approximate numeric values. Use exact comparisons.
- DO NOT assume risk unless the data explicitly meets or exceeds known risk thresholds.
- If no parameters exceed their risk thresholds, respond with:
  {
    "risk_found": "false",
    "risk_condition": "",
    "triggers": {},
    "recommendation": "No health risk detected. Continue normal activity. ‚òÄÔ∏è"
  }

Remember: Only the JSON object should be returned, no wrapping text.
